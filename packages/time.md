In Go (Golang), the **`time`** package provides functionality for working with dates, times, durations, and clocks. You can perform various operations like formatting, parsing, manipulating, and comparing time values. It's a core package and extensively used in Go applications that need to manage time.

### Key Features of the `time` Package:

- **Getting current time**: Retrieve the current local or UTC time.
- **Time formatting**: Format time as a string using custom layouts.
- **Duration**: Work with time intervals (e.g., adding or subtracting time).
- **Parsing time**: Parse time strings into time objects.
- **Timers and sleep**: Create timers, use sleep, and delay execution.
- **Working with time zones**: Handle time in different time zones.

### **1. Getting the Current Time**

You can get the current time using `time.Now()`.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Get the current local time
	currentTime := time.Now()
	fmt.Println("Current Time:", currentTime)

	// Get the current UTC time
	currentUTC := time.Now().UTC()
	fmt.Println("Current UTC Time:", currentUTC)
}
```

- `time.Now()` returns the current local time.
- `time.Now().UTC()` returns the current time in UTC.

---

### **2. Formatting Time**

Time can be formatted using the `Format()` method in the `time` package. The format string uses a reference time `Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006`, which is a standard layout. You use this layout to define how you want your date and time to appear.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Get the current time
	currentTime := time.Now()

	// Format the current time into a custom layout
	formattedTime := currentTime.Format("2006-01-02 15:04:05")
	fmt.Println("Formatted Time:", formattedTime)

	// Another format example
	prettyTime := currentTime.Format("Monday, 02-Jan-06 03:04:05 PM")
	fmt.Println("Pretty Time:", prettyTime)
}
```

- `"2006-01-02 15:04:05"` is a custom format where:
  - `2006` is the year,
  - `01` is the month,
  - `02` is the day,
  - `15` is the hour (24-hour format),
  - `04` is the minute,
  - `05` is the second.

This layout is hardcoded in Go, and you should always use this reference time to define your format.

---

### **3. Parsing Time**

You can parse strings into time objects using the `time.Parse()` function.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Example of parsing a string into a time object
	timeString := "2025-01-06 14:30:00"
	layout := "2006-01-02 15:04:05"

	parsedTime, err := time.Parse(layout, timeString)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error parsing time:", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println("Parsed Time:", parsedTime)
}
```

- The `time.Parse()` function takes the format layout and the time string and returns a `time.Time` object.
- Ensure that the format layout matches the format of the time string.

---

### **4. Duration and Time Manipulation**

The `time.Duration` type represents the difference between two `time.Time` values. You can perform operations like adding or subtracting durations to manipulate time.

#### **a. Adding and Subtracting Time**

You can add or subtract `time.Duration` from a `time.Time`.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Get the current time
	currentTime := time.Now()
	fmt.Println("Current Time:", currentTime)

	// Add 2 hours to the current time
	addedTime := currentTime.Add(2 * time.Hour)
	fmt.Println("Time after adding 2 hours:", addedTime)

	// Subtract 30 minutes from the current time
	subtractedTime := currentTime.Add(-30 * time.Minute)
	fmt.Println("Time after subtracting 30 minutes:", subtractedTime)
}
```

- `currentTime.Add(2 * time.Hour)` adds 2 hours to the current time.
- `currentTime.Add(-30 * time.Minute)` subtracts 30 minutes from the current time.

#### **b. Working with Time Durations**

You can specify durations using various units such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Creating a duration of 5 hours and 30 minutes
	duration := 5*time.Hour + 30*time.Minute
	fmt.Println("Duration:", duration)

	// Example: Check if 5 hours and 30 minutes is greater than 6 hours
	greaterDuration := 6 * time.Hour
	if duration > greaterDuration {
		fmt.Println("5 hours and 30 minutes is greater than 6 hours")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("6 hours is greater than 5 hours and 30 minutes")
	}
}
```

- The `time.Duration` type allows you to work with durations, and you can add time units together to form custom durations.

---

### **5. Sleep and Timer**

You can use `time.Sleep()` to pause the execution of a program for a specific duration.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Program starting...")

	// Sleep for 3 seconds
	time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)

	fmt.Println("Program finished after 3 seconds.")
}
```

- `time.Sleep()` pauses the program for the specified duration (in this case, 3 seconds).

#### **a. Using Timer for Delayed Execution**

You can also use a `time.Timer` to execute something after a specific duration.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Create a timer that will trigger after 3 seconds
	timer := time.NewTimer(3 * time.Second)

	// Wait for the timer to expire
	<-timer.C
	fmt.Println("Timer expired after 3 seconds")
}
```

- `time.NewTimer()` creates a timer that sends the current time on the `C` channel once the specified duration elapses.

---

### **6. Time Comparisons**

You can compare `time.Time` values using comparison operators such as `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, and `!=`.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Get the current time
	currentTime := time.Now()

	// Create a time object for comparison
	futureTime := currentTime.Add(1 * time.Hour)

	// Compare the times
	if currentTime.Before(futureTime) {
		fmt.Println("Current time is before future time.")
	}
	if futureTime.After(currentTime) {
		fmt.Println("Future time is after current time.")
	}
}
```

- `currentTime.Before(futureTime)` checks if the current time is before the future time.
- `futureTime.After(currentTime)` checks if the future time is after the current time.

---

### **7. Time Zones**

You can work with time zones using the `time` package. You can convert time from one time zone to another.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Get the current time in UTC
	utcTime := time.Now().UTC()
	fmt.Println("UTC Time:", utcTime)

	// Load a time zone (e.g., "America/New_York")
	loc, err := time.LoadLocation("America/New_York")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error loading time zone:", err)
		return
	}

	// Convert UTC time to the new time zone
	nyTime := utcTime.In(loc)
	fmt.Println("New York Time:", nyTime)
}
```

- `time.LoadLocation()` loads the specified time zone.
- `utcTime.In(loc)` converts the time to the specified time zone.

---

### **8. Working with Unix Timestamps**

You can also work with Unix timestamps (seconds or nanoseconds since January 1, 1970).

#### **a. Convert Time to Unix Timestamp**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Get the current time
	currentTime := time.Now()

	// Convert to Unix timestamp (seconds)
	unixTimestamp := currentTime.Unix()
	fmt.Println("Unix Timestamp:", unixTimestamp)

	// Convert to Unix timestamp (nanoseconds)
	unixNano := currentTime.UnixNano()
	fmt.Println("Unix Nano Timestamp:", unixNano)
}
```

#### **b. Convert Unix Timestamp Back to Time**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Unix timestamp in seconds
	timestamp := int64(1672454400) // Example timestamp

	// Convert Unix timestamp to Time
	convertedTime := time.Unix(timestamp, 0)
	fmt.Println("Converted Time:", convertedTime)
}
```

- `time.Unix()` converts a Unix timestamp back to a `time.Time`.
