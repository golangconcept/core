# Interface in go lang

**Note:** `type keyowrds`

An interface type in go kind of like a definition. It defines and describes the exact methods that some other type must have.

One of the key features of Go is its support for interfaces. `Interfaces` in Go allow you to define a set of method signatures that any type can implement, providing a flexible and powerful way to write `generic code`.

##  Interface Embedding in Go

In addition to defining standalone interfaces, Go also allows you to embed interfaces within other interfaces. This is called `interface embedding`, and it provides a powerful way to compose interfaces.
