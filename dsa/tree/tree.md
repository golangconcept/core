### Types of Tree Traversal Algorithms

**4 Types of Tree Traversal Algorithms**

- `Inorder traversal`: Visits all nodes inside the left subtree, then visits the current node before visiting any node within the right subtree.
- `Preorder traversal`: Visits the current node before visiting any nodes inside left or right subtrees.
- `Postorder traversal`: Visits the current node after visiting all the nodes of left and right subtrees.
- `Level order traversal`: Visits nodes level-by-level and in left-to-right fashion at the same level.
