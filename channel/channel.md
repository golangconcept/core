# channel in golang

In Go, channels are a powerful feature of the language's concurrency model, enabling goroutines to `communicate with each other and synchronize execution`. 

- Channels provide a way for one goroutine to send data to another, allowing them to coordinate without the need for explicit locks or shared memory. 

They are a core part of Go's approach to concurrency, which is based on the `CSP` (**Communicating Sequential Processes**) model.
