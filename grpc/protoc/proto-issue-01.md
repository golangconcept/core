That error message:

> `protoc-gen-go: program not found or is not executable`

means that the Go plugin for `protoc` (the Protocol Buffers compiler) isn't installed or isn't in your system's `PATH`.

Here‚Äôs how to fix it step-by-step:

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Install `protoc-gen-go`

You can install it using `go install` (as of Go 1.17+):

```bash
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
```

Or specify a version if you need compatibility:

```bash
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@v1.34.1
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is in your `PATH`.

To add it:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

You can add that to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.).

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Install `protoc-gen-go-grpc` (if you're using gRPC)

If you're working with gRPC services, also install:

```bash
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Verify it's working

Make sure `protoc-gen-go` is now available:

```bash
which protoc-gen-go
```

You should see a valid path like `/home/youruser/go/bin/protoc-gen-go`.

---

### üß™ Bonus: Run a test compile

Assuming you have your `.proto` file ready:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. yourfile.proto
```

Or with gRPC:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. yourfile.proto
```

Let me know if you want help setting up a full proto ‚Üí Go workflow (including `Makefile`, folder structure, etc.) or if you're using modules like Buf or gRPC Gateway!
