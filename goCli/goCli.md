In Go (Golang), `dependency management` is a critical part of managing libraries and packages that your project relies on. Over time, Go has evolved its approach to dependency management, and several tools and methods have been introduced and refined.

This system allows developers to define project dependencies in a go.mod file and manage them with `go get`, `go build`, and other Go commands.
