# String in go lang

## Start Small Projects

Once you grasp the basics, try building small projects to apply what you’ve learned:

A command-line tool (e.g., a task manager or file manipulator).
A simple web server (e.g., a REST API).
A chat application using Goroutines and Channels.

## Practice Concurrency

Go's concurrency model is one of its strongest features. To understand it fully:

- Study the `Go Scheduler and how goroutines are scheduled`.
- Implement more complex concurrent solutions, like `web scrapers`, or even explore `Worker Pools`.

### Note: Performance and Optimizations

Once you’re comfortable with Go basics, start learning about performance optimizations, profiling tools (like pprof), and benchmarking. Go is known for its speed, and understanding how to write efficient Go code is a valuable skill.
