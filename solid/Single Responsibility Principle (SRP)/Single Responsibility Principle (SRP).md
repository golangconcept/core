# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The `Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)` is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, and it states that a class (or module) should have only one reason to change, `meaning it should only have one responsibility or task`.

The goal of SRP is to reduce complexity and improve maintainability by making sure each part of your system handles only one `concern` or `behavior`.

In Go, while the language doesn't explicitly use the `concept of classes`, the SRP can still be applied to `functions`, `types`, `structs`, and `methods`. This principle can be used in Go to guide `structuring your code`, making it more `modular`, `easier to test`, and `less prone to errors`.
