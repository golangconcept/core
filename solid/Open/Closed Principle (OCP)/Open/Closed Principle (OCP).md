# Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The `Open/Closed Principle (OCP)` is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design, which provides guidelines for creating software that is `maintainable`, `flexible`, and `scalable`.

### Recap of OCP:

- `Open for extension`: A class (or type) should be able to have its behavior extended, typically via inheritance or composition.
- `Closed for modification`: The existing code should not be modified. Instead, new functionality should be added in a way that does not change the existing code.
